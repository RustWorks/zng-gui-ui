# Command TODO

Commands core API is implemented, TODO implement extensions and test all use cases.

* Make default `command_property!` be widget is enabled.
* Add filter to `command_property!`.
  - We want to declare `on_cmd_disabled` like for some event properties do.

* Add common commands with localized name+info, test after implementing localization, will
  probably be a var binding.
* Implement *check-box* commands, probably an extension, need to test in menus when that is implemented.
