# Command TODO

Commands core API is implemented, TODO implement extensions and test all use cases.

* Add common commands with localized name+info, test after implementing localization, will
  probably be a var binding.
* Implement *check-box* commands, probably an extension, need to test in menus when that is implemented.
* Provide some commands in zero-ui-core?
    * Window controls.
    * Respawn (reload)?
