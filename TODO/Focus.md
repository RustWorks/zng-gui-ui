# Focus TODO

* Restore focus from `modal` focus scope to button that opened it. 
* Icon example, directional nav wraps around if the next item up is fully clipped, instead of scrolling.
    - Can we make the focus nav know that the focused target will be scrolled to?
* Support more than one ALT scopes.
    - Like the main-menu vs. a docked panel main tool-bar in Visual Studio.
* Mnemonics.

* Directional nav shortcuts are easily suppressed by other commands.
    - Just by having a `Scroll!` as parent for example.
    - Maybe we can have a property that boosts the priority of focus nav commands in a context?
