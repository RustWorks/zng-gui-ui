* Implement monitor changed event.
  - when monitor changes: See WindowVars::monitor()
  - actual_monitor: Computed by intersection between window and monitors? (the monitor area that contains more than half of the window?)

* Implement and test window respawn (need to test NVIDIA actual driver version change (two blinks)).
* Implement software rendering using https://github.com/servo/webrender/tree/master/swgl
  - Its easy to build in Windows but does not work by default (use an optional feature?)
  - There is no `swgl` crate, we will need to link to the git, and it needs to match the `webrender` commit.
  - We should use the latest sync commit from the Firefox stable version.
    - Currently it is https://github.com/servo/webrender/commit/526a423bc2f069ea90e219fb155f379ee0fe662a for Firefox 92.0
    - https://crates.io does not allow git dependencies, but it allows the use of `git submodule`s, adding them to our crate.
    - Found by following the `ghsync` link and checking the Firefox milestone.

* Window ID generated by the client?


* Frame rendered event and AppExtension method, with hit-test.
* Review screenshot, webrender has some methods for it?
* Separate API to different crate, like `webrender_api`?
  * Promote methods to a trait? This allows custom backends (but still using webrender)
