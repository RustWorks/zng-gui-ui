# Parallel UI

* How much overhead needed to add `rayon` join support for UiNode methods?
    * Need to make every thing sync.
    * Vars are already *locked* for updates due to their delayed assign, is only reading from `Arc` slower then from `Rc`?
    * Event `stop_propagation` becomes indeterministic.
    * Services must become sync.
    * State must become sync!
* Maybe can always have an AppContext for each UI thread, with a copy of services and such, after each update they merge into
  the main AppContext.

# Mouse Move Interest

* Let widgets define what sort of mouse event they want, use the hit-test tag, filter events in the view-process?

# Update Mask

* Sub-divide UiNodeList masks.

# Startup

* NVIDIA OpenGL takes 200ms! to startup.
* First render is also slow.
* We block the app process waiting view-process startup.

# Cache Everything

General idea, reuse computed data for `UiNode` info, layout and render at
widget boundaries if the widget or inner widgets did not request an update of these types.

## `UiNode::layout`

* Already started implementing this, see `LayoutMask`.

## `UiNode::render`

* Already started implementing this, see `ReuseGroups`.
  - Webrender reuse depends on space/clip ids and these invalidate all items after an insert remove.
  - Worst, we can't cache creation of space/clips because it will just mess-up the id count for all subsequent items.
  - Maybe we should stop using the webrender display list.

# Image Render

* Try reusing renderer.

# View Open

* Try to detect unsupported render mode without glutin.
* Try to implement async context creation in default view crate.
    - Problem, glutin needs the event-loop window target to build a context (it is not send and must be in main).
    - Can use `build_raw_context` that only requires a window handle, so we create the winit window blocking then offload
      everything to a thread.
    - gleam uses a `Rc<dyn Gl>` for the OpenGL functions.
    - There are obscure bugs with sending OpenGL contexts across threads, maybe review using `surfman` again.
