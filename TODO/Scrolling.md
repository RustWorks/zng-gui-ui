# Scrolling TODO

* Webrender has some scrolling API, need to figure it out.
* Need a way to link scroll-bars with scroll frame.
* How this ties in with virtualization.
* Need to set variables in layout?
* Widgets may want to know what percentage of an widget is visible in the viewport, see flutter "slivers" concept.
* "Sliver" widgets may change size due to scrolling.
* Most other frameworks have specific widgets for the scroll area, we probably want this too, the "scrollable" property
  will require yet another property priority to work otherwise.
