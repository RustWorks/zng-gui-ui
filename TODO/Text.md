# Text TODO

* Implement wrapping, text align and justify.
* Implement font-features.
* Review TODOs in code.

# Underline Skip Glyphs

* Underline padding does not look right for some curved glyphs (parenthesis shows this), consider improving the `h_line_hits`.

# Mixed Content

* Implement text runs composed of multiple styles, same problem as font fallback?
* Implement widgets that derive text runs and styles from the text.
    - Markdown.
    - ANSI coloring (to show basic Inspector in a window).

# Selection

* Implement text selection, need to dynamically replace a text range with a different style.
