# Themes TODO

* Implement `toggle::value` and `toggle::selected_value` to allow implementing a radio button effect from `toggle`.
    - Use this in all "when powered" radio button in examples.
* Test All.
* Merge.

* Implement dynamic when states, so that the same property name can participate of `when` chains declared across
    multiple places.
* Document dynamic constructors in `#[widget]`.
* Make more widgets themable.
* Rename all "theme" sub-modules of widgets to `vis`.
* Create a `ColorVars` in `window!` and derive all widget colors from it.
