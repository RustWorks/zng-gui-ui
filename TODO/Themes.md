# Themes TODO

* Because themes don't override properties, some unexpected results can happen, for example
    setting `padding` on a theme and on the widget causes a sum of both paddings to be added.

* Rename all "theme" sub-modules of widgets to `vis`.
* Make more widgets themable.

* Implement system theme initial value in view-process.
