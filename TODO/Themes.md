# Themes TODO

* Release build does not work.
* Image example noticeable slower with new dynamic buttons.
* Review docs of color mix methods, not clear what color is over the other.

* Test All.
* Merge.

* Document dynamic constructors in `#[widget]`.
* Make more widgets themable.
* Rename all "theme" sub-modules of widgets to `vis`.
* Create a `ColorVars` in `window!` and derive all widget colors from it.
