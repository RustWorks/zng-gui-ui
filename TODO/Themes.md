# Themes TODO

* Implement dynamic when states, so that the same property name can participate of `when` chains declared across
    multiple places.
* Make more widgets themable.
* Rename all "theme" sub-modules of widgets to `vis`.
* Create a `ColorVars` in `window!` and derive all widget colors from it.
