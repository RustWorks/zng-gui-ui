## Basic Layout

Layout widgets.

* Refactor `v_stack/h_stack/z_stack` to `column/row/stack`.
* Refactor `wrap` to `row_wrap` and implement `column_wrap`.
* Implement properties that work with any panel to draw lines in between items.
  - Also backgrounds and foregrounds for each item.
  - Cell borders that don't affect size.
  - Selection borders, backgrounds.
* Implement `grid`, that works like overlapping row/columns.
* Implement reverse `UiNodeList` and other ops in the lists directly.
  - Like sorting and the z-index has worked well, other auto-updating "iterator inspired" helpers are probably pretty cool.

## Virtualizing Widgets

Widgets that contain many elements that must be loaded on demand.

* ListView.
* TreeView.
* GridView.
* TabView.
* Infinite Canvas.

## Window Widgets

Widgets that stay at the root of the Window and define type of app interaction that is used in the window.

* Custom decoration.
* Wizard.
* Ribbon.
* Docking editor.

## Themes

* Is a style collection.
* High contrast.
* OS imitation?

## OS Integration

* MainMenu.
* TaskbarItemInfo.

## Dialogs

* Message dialogs (styleable?).
* File dialogs (not styleable?).

## Inspector

Widget inspector.

* Console, a print-out of the window state.
* UI, an interactive window like the browsers inspectors.
