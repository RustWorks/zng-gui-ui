# Documentation

* Add better documentation, examples, for all modules in the main crate.
* Review docs in other crates, they must link to the main crate?

# Publish

* Publish if there is no missing component that could cause a core API refactor.

* Rename crates (replace zero-ui with something that has no hyphen). 
    - Z meaning depth opens some possibilities, unfortunately "zui" is already taken.
    - `znest`: Z-dimension (depth) + nest, Z-Nest, US pronunciation "zee nest"? 
    - `zerui`.
    - `nestui`.

* Review prebuild distribution.
* Pick license and code of conduct.
* Create a GitHub user for the project?
* Create issues for each TODO.

* Publish (after all TODOs in this file resolved).
* Announce in social media.

* After publish only use pull requests.
    - We used a lot of partial commits during development.
    - Is that a problem in git history?
    - Research how other projects handled this issue.
