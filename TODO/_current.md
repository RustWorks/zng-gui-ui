# TextInput

* Support replace (Insert mode in command line).
* Support buttons:
    - page up and page down
* Implement selection.
    - Input replaces selection.
        - Char input, paste, IME
    - Impl cut & copy.
* Research text editors.

* Implement custom node access to text.
    - Clone text var in `ResolvedText`?
    - Getter property `get_transformed_text`, to get the text after whitespace transforms?

* Implement IME.
    - See https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1497

* Watermark text shows caret, it should not for multiple reasons:
    - The txt property is not set to a read-write var.
    - Background widgets are not interactive.

* Ctrl+Shift+I when focusing TextInput inserts a tab and still opens the Inspector.
    - We are receiving a TAB for some reason, but we are stopping propagation.
    - Char event is not linked with key press event stop propagation does nothing.
        - Is a different event from Winit.
        - The next version of Winit will fix this: https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/753

# Undo Service

* Work on variables.
    - Can track a var in a context, when CTRL+Z is pressed and the context is focused
      the variable is set to a previous value.
    - Use var modify tags to avoid updates generated by the Undo service.
* Interop
    - Not the most efficient way to implement undo for all value types.
        - A large text will be cloned for example.
            - And the caret will not be restored to the same place.
    - Make modify tag public.
    - Let any code register undo units.
        - They may have associated meta.
        - Like a display name for UIs that show the undo stack.
    - Undo units will be merged by time.
        - Explicit require merge too?
            - This can be used to always merge the caret position undo with the text undo.

# View-Process

* Implement OpenGL example.
    - Overlay and texture image.
