# Pre-Merge

* Animation flickering.
* Window-auto size.
* Align content larger then max? See hit_test example.
* Baseline align.
* Scrollable.
    - Panorama image set to fill.
* Layers & Custom transforms info.
    - Replace LayoutInfo to a single one per-widget that contains all the transforms applied by the widget?
    - Right now we have "outer" applied with "inner", could be a single entry?

* Fix all warnings.
* Pass all tests.
* Docs without warnings.
