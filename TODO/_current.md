# Documentation

* Add `description`, `documentation`, `repository`, `readme`, `categories`, `keywords`.
    - Review what other large crates do.
    - Review badges.

# Publish

* Publish if there is no missing component that could cause a core API refactor.

* Rename crates to:
    - `zng`: Z + Nest + Graphics (pronunciation: zing).

* Review prebuild distribution.
* Pick license and code of conduct.
* Create a GitHub user for the project?
* Create issues for each TODO.

* Publish (after all TODOs in this file resolved).
* Announce in social media.

* After publish only use pull requests.
    - We used a lot of partial commits during development.
    - Is that a problem in git history?
    - Research how other projects handled this issue.
