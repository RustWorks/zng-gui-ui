    - The image example tries to do this manually, but there is some flickering due to Px rounding on the scroll vs on the offset.
    - CSS has the "position" property, that has sticky, webrender has something for this that we can use?

* Review layout double-pass of stacks.
* Fix text final size, either clip or return accurate size.

* Scrolling, see `Scrolling.md`.
* Animation, see `Variables.md`.
