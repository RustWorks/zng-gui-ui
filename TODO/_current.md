* Text Editable
    - Caret.

* `text_input!`.
    - Inherit from `text!`.
    - Appearance of a text-box.
* IME.

* Review, can we remove outer-transform/bounds?
    - It is updated in `push_inner` anyway.
    - It halves the computation of bounds if removed.
    - Can layout be done without `outer_offset`?
        - If not we can still remove the outer transform, outer offset remains just a vector for the layout pass only.
