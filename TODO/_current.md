# TextInput

* Implement selection.
    - Input replaces selection.
        - Char input, paste, IME
    - Impl cut & copy.

* Implement IME.
    - See https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1497

# Text

* Implement text clip.
    - Ellipses, fade-out.
    - Very visible in icon example.

# View-Process

* Update to winit-29 when released.
    - Lots of breaking changes.
* Implement OpenGL example.
    - Overlay and texture image.
* Implement automation/screen reader APIs.

# Transform 3D

* Perspective (and origin) is computed on the parent.
    - Firefox creates a stacking-context for the perspective transform on its own.
    - There is a `paired_with_perspective` flag in the stacking-context.
    - Fix the cube example.
* Implement perspective render_update.
    - For now transform updates request full render (!!:).

* backface_visible, sets webrender `PrimitiveFlags::IS_BACKFACE_VISIBLE`.
    - Flag can be set in any primitive, figure out why?
    - Can we just have a context push?

# WR Items

* Finish items implemented by webrender.
    - Perspective and backface stuff.

    - Touch events.
        - Use `Spacedesk` to generate touch events.

* Review `RasterSpace::Screen` usage.
    - Firefox controls this (only Screen if stacking-context is not animating).
