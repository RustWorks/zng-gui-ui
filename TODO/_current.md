* Bug, `when` changed UI node causes update before info.
    - In text example, collapse the menu to the smaller size.

# TextInput

* Support replace (Insert mode in command line).
* Support buttons:
    - page up and page down
* Implement selection.
    - Input replaces selection.
        - Char input, paste, IME
    - Impl cut & copy.
* Research text editors.

* Implement custom node access to text.
    - Clone text var in `ResolvedText`?
    - Getter property `get_transformed_text`, to get the text after whitespace transforms?

* Implement IME.
    - See https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1497

* Watermark text shows caret, it should not for multiple reasons:
    - The txt property is not set to a read-write var.
    - Background widgets are not interactive.

* Ctrl+Shift+I when focusing TextInput inserts a tab and still opens the Inspector.
    - We are receiving a TAB for some reason, but we are stopping propagation.
    - Char event is not linked with key press event stop propagation does nothing.
        - Is a different event from Winit.
        - The next version of Winit will fix this: https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/753

# Undo Service

* Impl max stack limit.
* Impl grouping.
    - By time.
    - Custom group?
* Helper for variables.
    - Can track a var in a context, when CTRL+Z is pressed and the context is focused
      the variable is set to a previous value.
    - Use var modify tags to avoid updates generated by the Undo service.
* Stack marker.
    - Like an id action that does nothing by it self, but can be used as
      param on the commands to rollback actions.
* Custom `Text!` undo action.
    - No need to clone the entire text.
    - Track caret position?
        - Or at least set it when undoing an insert for example.
- UNDO_CMD button.
    - Review `Commands.md`.
    - Add undo list reference to the command meta?
        - For use in "Undo Stack" widgets.

# View-Process

* Implement OpenGL example.
    - Overlay and texture image.
