# Layout TODO

* Track widget bounds `LayoutPassId`?

## Inline Align::FILL

* Support `Justify`, enabled by `Align::FILL`.
* Implement fill/justify in `Wrap!`.
  - Use segments API to control spacing all from the parent?
    - Remove `first_max_fill` and `last_max_fill`.

## Direction

* Expand `LayoutDirection` to support vertical text, and to control the direction *rows* are added.
  - See CSS `writing-mode`, lang define direction glyphs flow, but also direction wrap grows.
  - Or we can have specialized vertical text and wrap widgets.
    - Text and wrap code is already very complex, a separate widget may be more easy to maintain.
  - Does vertical text need to implement bidi sorting?
  - Can vertical and horizontal be mixed?
    - Yes, and we can have any widget in wrap so a `vertical_text` can be inserted as a block.
  - CSS has vertical text that is just rotated.
    - This can be done with something like `rotate_layout` that implements layout rotation in  90ยบ increments 
      (swaps the constrain axis and renders a transform).
        - Need to set a context flag for properties like `cursor` to swap visual.
        - Need to clear inline info.
* Integrate `LayoutDirection` with all widgets.
  - grid, mirror grid indexes.

## Inline

* Review properties that disable inline, maybe they can support it with the new API?
  - First `foreground_highlight`, as it is used to draw the keyboard focus indicator in text links.

## Grid 

* Cell align.
* Column & Row align for when all fixed is less then available.
* Masonry align?
* Support `lft` in spacing.
        - And padding? Need to capture padding if the case.
* Add contextual grid info, like the text `TextLayout`, to allow custom properties to extent it (like an special border property).

# Responsive Layout

* Right now we use the `actual_width` to implement something like *media query* and give it a margin of error
  for different localizations. Review what else is typical for media queries.

# Easing Layout

* Implement property that a animates between layout and transform changes.

```
/// Chase animate the widget inner bounds layout and transform.
///
/// The `duration` defines the maximum duration used for changes equal or greater then 50dip, smaller changes use
/// a proportional smaller duration.
///
/// Inline widgets only animate the transform, not size.
#[property(WIDGET_INNER, default(0.ms(), EasingFn::None))]
pub fn easing_layout(child: impl UiNode, duration: impl IntoVar<Duration>, easing: impl IntoVar<EasingFn>) -> impl UiNode {
    let duration = duration.into_var();
    let easing = easing.into_var();
    match_node(child, move |c, op| match op {
        UiNodeOp::Layout { wl, final_size } => {
            if wl.is_inline() {
                return;
            }
            let (uses, _) = LAYOUT.capture_metrics_use(|| c.measure(&mut wl.to_measure(None)));
        }
        _ => {}
    })
}

```
