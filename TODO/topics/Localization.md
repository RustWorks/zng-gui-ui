# Localization TODO

* Fluent crate does not provide any built-in functions.
    - Specs don't say they are optional.
    - See: https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs/issues/313

* Implement a better localization menu for the example.
    - Button in the corner, show all lang preferences.
    - Pop-up that allows selecting all lang preferences.
        - Two lists?
