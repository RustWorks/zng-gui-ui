# Touch TODO

* Swipe to dismiss.
    - Widget is moved with transform, when touch is released the widget animates back into place or
      out if the threshold for closing was crossed.

* We want the same gesture in combo box of clicking and dragging to the option.
    - Maybe use the swipe/fling gesture?

* Implement "Ripple!" visual.
    - Radial background overlay animation fired on every touch or click.

* Improve `touch_transform`.
    - Contextual origin.
    - Config persistence.
