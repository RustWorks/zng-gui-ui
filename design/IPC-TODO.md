* Implement monitor changed event.
  - when monitor changes: See WindowVars::monitor()
  - actual_monitor: Computed by intersection between window and monitors? (the monitor area that contains more than half of the window?)
* Implement clear-color from first background color, can see when toggling the chrome.
* Auto-size should reset when the user resizes.

* Implement and test window respawn (need to test NVIDIA actual driver version change (two blinks)).
