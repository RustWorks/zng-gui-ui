# Enabled by default.

# This speeds-up compilation time at the cost of runtime.

# USAGE:
#
# For zero-ui-core maintainers, use `#[cfg(feature="test_util")]` in the helper types and places where
# the types are used. Use `do` to run integration tests.
#
# For external dependents, build with this feature to use the test helper types that show
# in the documentation.
