# Enables pre-build views and connecting to views running in another process.
# 
# Enabled by default.
ipc = ["zero-ui-core/ipc"]

# Enables http tasks.
#
# Enabled by default.
http = ["zero-ui-core/http"]

# Signal the `zero-ui-core` build script to enable the `dyn_*` and `inspector` features for debug builds.
#
# Enabled by default.
debug_default = ["zero-ui-core/debug_default"]

# Use dynamic dispatch at the node level by placing each property node in a `BoxedUiNode` and enabling `UiNode::cfg_boxed`.
#
# This speeds-up compilation time at the cost of runtime.
dyn_node = ["zero-ui-core/dyn_node"]

# Instrument each property and widget instance with "Inspector" nodes.
inspector = ["zero-ui-core/inspector"]

# Use dynamic dispatch at the app-extension level.
#
# This speeds-up compilation time at the cost of runtime.
dyn_app_extension = ["zero-ui-core/dyn_app_extension"]

# Box closures at opportune places, such as `Var::map`, reducing the number of monomorphised types.
#
# This speeds-up compilation time at the cost of runtime.
dyn_closure = ["zero-ui-core/dyn_closure"]

# like cfg(test) but also visible in docs and integration tests.
#
# USAGE:
#
# Build with this feature to use the core test helper types that show
# in the documentation.
test_util = ["zero-ui-core/test_util"]

# Instrument every widget outer-most node to trace UI methods.
trace_widget = ["zero-ui-core/trace_widget"]

# Instrument every property node to trace UI methods.
#
# Note that this can cause very large trace files and bad performance.
trace_property = ["zero-ui-core/trace_property"]

# # Other Features
#
# ## `doc_nightly`
#
# Activates nightly only `rustdoc` features. The crate is already configured to use this feature
# in "docs.rs" and `do doc`.
# 
# Use `#![cfg_attr(doc_nightly, feature(doc_foo))]` in the `lib.rs` to activate a `rustdoc` feature. Then
# use `#[cfg_attr(doc_nightly, doc(foo))]` in an item.
# 
# Use `RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg doc_nightly" cargo +nightly doc` to run `cargo doc` without using `do`.
