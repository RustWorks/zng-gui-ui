//! Window events, [`on_window_open`](fn@on_window_open) and [`on_window_close_requested`](fn@on_window_close_requested).
//!
//! These events are re-exported by [`Window!`](mod@crate::widgets::window) as `on_open` and `on_close_requested`, but you can
//! attach then in any widget inside a window using the property full name.
//!
//! There is no event property for the [`WINDOW_CLOSE_EVENT`](crate::core::window::WINDOW_CLOSE_EVENT) because that event notifies
//! after the window is deinited. You can use [`on_deinit`](fn@crate::properties::events::widget::on_deinit) in the
//! [`Window!`](mod@crate::widgets::window) widget to handle a window closing, or create an app level handler for the
//! event using [`EVENTS`](crate::core::event::EVENTS).
